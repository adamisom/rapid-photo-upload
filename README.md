## ⚠️ **AWS Cost Control - Built-In Limits**

**To prevent runaway AWS bills, the following hard limits are enforced:**

| Limit Type | Value | Error Message |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| **Max Users** | 50 total users | "Can't register more users at this time" |
| **Max Photos** | 1,500 total photos | "You've reached your image limit" |
| **Max Storage** | 500 MB total | "You've reached your image limit" |
| **Max File Size** | 100 MB per file | "Image too large (max 100 MB)" |

These limits are checked server-side before any upload or registration occurs. See `LimitsService.java` for implementation details.

## Test Images

The `100-test-images/` folder contains sample images for testing upload functionality:
- **100 total images** for testing medium batch uploads
- **Most images**: Small ImageNet samples (50-300KB)
- **12 pexels_* files**: High-resolution photos (1-3MB each) for realistic testing

Use these images to test:
- Single file uploads
- Batch uploads (10-20 files)
- Medium session support (100 files)
- Progress tracking and time estimates

### Testing with 1000+ Images

For large batch testing (1000+ images), see **[LARGE_BATCH_TESTING.md](docs/misc/LARGE_BATCH_TESTING.md)** which provides:
- Links to free Kaggle datasets (Natural Images, Caltech 101, etc.)
- Download instructions
- Testing scenarios and expected performance
- Troubleshooting guide

**Recommended Dataset**: [Natural Images on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasunroy/natural-images) - 8,000+ real-world photos perfect for testing.

## Architecture Overview

- **Backend**: Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.4.x (DDD, CQRS, VSA)
- **Web**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Mobile**: React Native + Expo + TypeScript
- **Storage**: AWS S3 with presigned URLs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Spring Data JPA
- **Auth**: JWT with Spring Security

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Backend Foundation (Auth + Domain Model)
2. **Phase 2**: S3 Integration & Upload API
3. **Phase 3**: Photo Query & Gallery API
4. **Phase 4**: Web Client (React)
5. **Phase 5**: Web Client Gallery
6. **Phase 6**: Mobile Client (React Native)
7. **Phase 7**: Testing & Polish

## Key Features

✅ **Concurrent uploads up to 100 files** - Direct-to-S3 with presigned URLs  
✅ **Real-time progress tracking** - Byte-based progress with ETA calculations  
✅ **Photo tagging** - Up to 3 tags per photo with autocomplete suggestions  
✅ **Retry failed uploads** - Graceful error handling with one-click retry  
✅ **Upload batch history** - Track and review previous upload sessions  
✅ **JWT authentication** - Secure token-based auth with Spring Security  
✅ **Responsive UI** - Works seamlessly on web and mobile  
✅ **Full CRUD for photos** - Upload, view, tag, download, and delete  
✅ **Load tested** - Verified with 100 concurrent uploads × 2MB files  

## What Makes This Special?

### 🏗️ Enterprise Architecture Patterns
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Rich domain entities with clear aggregate boundaries
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write operations for optimal performance
- **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Features organized as independent slices

### ⚡ Performance & Scalability
- **Presigned URLs**: Offload 99% of bandwidth to S3 (backend stays lightweight)
- **Atomic Operations**: `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` handles race conditions elegantly
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Async throughout (backend NIO, frontend parallel uploads)
- **Byte-based Progress**: Accurate progress even with mixed file sizes

### 🐛 Battle-Tested
- Fixed 5 critical bugs through extensive manual testing
- Load tested with 100 concurrent uploads (200MB total)
- Handles edge cases: partial failures, retries, stale state

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Development
- Built with Cursor IDE + Claude Sonnet 3.5
- 20-30 hours of human-AI collaboration
- Comprehensive documentation of the process

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
AWS_S3_BUCKET=rapidphotoupload-adamisom

```

## Documentation

- **Implementation Guide**: See `IMPLEMENTATION_TASK_GUIDE.md` for detailed Phase 1-3 tasks
- **PRD**: See `RapidPhotoUpload_Implementation_PRD.md` for full specification

## Testing

### Manual Testing (Web UI)

1. Start backend: `cd backend && mvn spring-boot:run`
2. Start web: `cd web && npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`
4. Register and login
5. Upload test images from `100-test-images/` folder

### Load Testing Script

Test concurrent upload performance with the automated load test:

```bash
# Run load test with 100 photos × 2MB
./scripts/load-test.sh

# Run custom load test
./scripts/load-test.sh 50 1    # 50 photos × 1MB
./scripts/load-test.sh 200 5   # 200 photos × 5MB
```

**Requirements**:
- `jq` installed: `brew install jq`
- Backend running on `localhost:8080`
- PostgreSQL and S3 configured

**What it tests**:
- Concurrent upload initiation (100 presigned URLs in <90s)
- Parallel S3 uploads (10 at a time)
- Database integrity (batch status, photo records)
- End-to-end upload flow

### Database Management

**Clean database before testing**:

```bash
# Delete all photos and batches (keeps users)
./backend/scripts/delete-all-photos.sh
```

This is useful when you want to:
- Start fresh for a new load test
- Clear test data
- Reset upload counts

### API Testing (Postman/curl)

1. Register user: `POST /api/auth/register`
2. Login: `POST /api/auth/login`
3. Initiate upload: `POST /api/upload/initiate`
4. Complete upload: `POST /api/upload/complete/{photoId}`
5. Poll status: `GET /api/upload/batch/{batchId}/status`
6. List photos: `GET /api/photos`

## Contributing

This project demonstrates enterprise-grade architectural patterns:
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** for domain modeling
- **CQRS** for command/query separation  
- **Vertical Slice Architecture** for feature organization

### Code Quality Standards

✅ All services follow CQRS pattern (CommandService vs QueryService)  
✅ Domain entities have comprehensive JavaDoc  
✅ No console.logs in production code (only console.error for debugging)  
✅ All tests pass (`mvn clean install` shows 0 errors)  
✅ Load test verified with 100 concurrent uploads  

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Follow existing patterns**: Match the DDD/CQRS/VSA structure
2. **Add tests**: Unit tests for services, integration tests for flows
3. **Update docs**: Keep ARCHITECTURE.md in sync with code changes
4. **Security review**: Manually review any auth/security code
5. **Test concurrency**: Use `load-test.sh` to verify high-load scenarios

### AI-Assisted Development
